Build a simple to-do list application using React (TypeScript). The application should allow users to:
- [x] Add new to-do items with a title, optional description, and a due date.
- [x] Mark existing to-do items as complete or incomplete.
- [x] Filter for to-do items (show all, completed, incomplete, overdue).
- [x] Delete to-do items with confirmation.
- [x] Undo the last deleted item within 15 seconds.

Technical Requirements:
- Persist the to-do list data in local storage.
- Use a state management library like Redux.
- Use a CSS framework like Ant Design to style the application.
- Implement unit tests for critical components and functionalities.
